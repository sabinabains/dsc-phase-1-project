Animation films outperformed all other genres with a median profit of 196.4MM.  Median budget for this genre was 85MM.

Adventure and Sci-Fi have high average profits as well while keeping low costs

Action and Fantasy genres have higher budgets than profit on average, and therefore are risky

Using the median rather than the mean excludes potential outliers in films, further demonstrating Animation films as a clear winner

# Conclusions and Recomnedations

* Kick off Microsoft’s movie studio by creating an animation film, as this genre generates the highest profits with
minimal risk of costing more than its gross earnings.  Adventure and Sci-Fi films also generate high
profits with relatively low budgets.

* Utilizing experienced crew members in the Animation genre such as Pierre Coffin as Director,  Janey Healy as Producer, and Michael Giacchino as composer will yield successful films. These creators also demonstrate versatility across genres.

* Microsoft should prioritize releasing films in May, June, or July, as viewers are more likely to hit the movie theatre in these months.  Avoid delaying movie releases, as late summer and early fall generate the lowest gross among films.
